With over 5 years of experience in building ML solutions for multiple industries and a specialised MSc in AI/ML from Imperial College London, I excel in developing and deploying Computer Vision models and LLM-based applications for scalable and resource-constrained inference environments. 

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Beam, where I build highly performant and scalable ML solutions to accelerate key processes in offshore wind energy projects. Previously, as a Senior Engineer at Sony, I spearheaded multiple ML projects to optimise business operations, driving impact and innovation across various Sony entities.

Beyond technical proficiency, I bring a strong culture of cross-functional collaboration, aligning stakeholders, translating business requirements into actionable ML objectives, mentoring junior engineers, and shaping ML development roadmaps. I am passionate about continuous learning and advancing my knowledge to develop robust, high-performing and responsible ML solutions.
