Her engineering background gives her an attention to detail thatâ€™s valuable in an ML team - her work is robust, reliable, tested well, and well as thoughtfully considered in the context of wider MLOps systems and deployment processes. Would recommend Latha to anyone looking to get their ML out of pilot and into production."}]}
