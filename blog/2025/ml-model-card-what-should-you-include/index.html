I wanted to document further about the concept of “Model card” — its general structure, purpose and why it's needed in ML workflows.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1006/1*EFUqWzVWCc52WCk3_LycnA.png"><figcaption>Google’s recommendation of a model card [from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">paper</a> published in 2019]</figcaption></figure> <p>A model card is a standardised documentation framework introduced to enhance transparency and accountability in ML systems. It provides critical metadata about an ML model. Typically, a well-structured model card could include sections such as:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Model details</strong>: A description of what the model does, its architecture, and its version.</li> <li> <strong>Intended use</strong>: Context and applications where the model is suitable, along with explicitly stated <em>out-of-scope</em> use cases.</li> <li> <strong>Training and evaluation datasets</strong>: Detailed information on the datasets used for training, validation, and testing, including any preprocessing steps.</li> <li> <strong>Factors: </strong>Model cards ideally provide a summary of model performance across a variety of relevant factors, including groups, instrumentation, and environments.</li> <li> <strong>Metrics</strong>: The chosen evaluation metrics should reflect the potential real-world impacts of the model.</li> <li> <strong>Ethical considerations</strong>: Acknowledgement of potential harms, misuse scenarios or societal impacts.</li> <li> <strong>Limitations and recommendations</strong>: Areas where the model may underperform or produce unreliable results. Any recommendations towards using the model could also be provided to give a better understanding to the user.</li> </ul> <p>Model cards act as an internal checkpoint during development and a communication tool for external stakeholders. They also support reproducibility, regulatory compliance, and responsible deployment practices, especially important as ML systems continue to be integrated into high-stakes domains. There are also multiple variations of model cards, such as those used for <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-3/blob/master/model-card.md" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GPT-3</a> or <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">models hosted on Hugging Face</a>.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/714/1*EbEzJqATq7fznLbNR_iqtg.png"><figcaption>An example model card from the paper</figcaption></figure> <p>Essentially, I strongly believe the model cards are not one-size-fits-all. The depth and level of details often depend on who is using the model and how mature the team’s MLOps practices are. Nonetheless, model cards should be treated as living documents, something you revisit, refine and improve over time as part of building AI responsibly and transparently.</p> <h3>References</h3> <ul> <li>Paper “Model cards for Model Reporting”: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993</a> </li> <li>HuggingFace write up on Model Cards: <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards</a> </li> <li>OpenAI GPT-3 Model Card: <a href="https://github.com/openai/gpt-3/blob/master/model-card.md" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/openai/gpt-3/blob/master/model-card.md</a> </li> </ul> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7a5f45cc9d36" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
